    "DP is a way to solve problem with *memory*, like a dp table. One can refer to the previous memory for a sub-solution, instead of calculating again.\n",
    "\n",
    "A way to think of DP problem is imagine a little bird just tell you the perfect answer `s[n]`, and then you organize how this `s[n]` relates to `s[n-1]` and so on. By so, we can organize the **transformation function**, which is the most important part in DP problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the [`Climbing Stairs`](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/description/) problem can be expressed as following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    s[n] = s[n-1] + s[n-2]\n",
    "    \n",
    "where `s[n]` means the number of ways to climbing `n` stairs. This is the definition of the **state** or the **dp table**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the final **answer** is just the last element of dp table. That is, we only need to follow the rule above. However, in some cases, the last element should be treated differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "So where did this start? Since everything counts on the previous solution, then we need a **initialization**. At the very begining, it's always easy to think for only 1 or 2 stairs. Generally speaking, one needs to initailize edge cases (first several elements of an array, first several cols/rows of a matrix, so on), sometimes it requires a whole initailization for the whole table to make things easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the four elements to construct an solution to a DP problem:\n",
    "1. DP table/state definition: how to reduce the problem to smaller ones\n",
    "2. Transformation function: how to construct the answer with previous solutions\n",
    "3. Initialization\n",
    "4. Final answer"
